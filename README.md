This repository contains a solution to the Martian Robots problem.

To run the solution:
Clone this repository: git clone <repository_url>
In file martianRobots.py, you can uncomment the last line of the code: # mainProcess('5 3 3 2 N FRRFLLFFRRFLL') and provide your data in line separated by spaces. 
Navigate to the cloned directory: cd <repository_name>
Execute the script: python martianRobots.py

To run a test file TestMartianRobots.py, it is better to comment the last line of the code in martianRobots.py: mainProcess('5 3 3 2 N FRRFLLFFRRFLL')

Next Steps:
I would prefer to discuss in what way an input is coming and change the script accordingly.
Break down the main functions into smaller, more focused functions.
Improving error handling.
Unit tests could be expanded to cover more scenarios and edge cases.

This solution aims for simplicity, readability, and correctness within a reasonable time frame.
